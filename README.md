# SciFi UI Project

# Description of the assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to develop a better understanding of the Java environment as well as using the Processing library in order to create a user interface with a science fiction theme. This resulting creation can either be something which already exists in the form of a movie or computer game or it can be completely self-created. It needs to have animation and interactivity as well as show and utilize all the aspects which have been learned during the OOP module.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
