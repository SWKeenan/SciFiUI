# Description of the assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to develop a better understanding of the Java environment as well as using the Processing library in order to create a user interface with a science fiction theme. This resulting creation can either be something which already exists in the form of a movie or computer game or it can be completely self-created. It needs to have animation and interactivity as well as show and utilize all the aspects which have been learned during the OOP module.

# Example of Code

This is a segment of code which was used to add a noise and response effect when the user didn't press a button but instead tapped on the monitor or the computer terminal:

```Java

            else if(mouseX>100 && mouseX<700 && mouseY>50 && mouseY<300){
                ping.play();
                ping.rewind();
                if(tapOn){
                    fill(255);
                    ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,10,10);
                }
            }

            else if(mouseX>0 && mouseX<width && mouseY>0 && mouseY < height){
                clank.play();
                clank.rewind();
                if(tapOn){
                    fill(255);
                    ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,10,10);
                }
            }
```
